    <p class="paragraph-one">
      At Tesla‚Äôs ‚ÄúWe Robot‚Äù event in Burbank, California, earlier this week, CEO Elon Musk showed off the company‚Äôs
      vision for the future with the highly anticipated Cybercab autonomous taxi and a larger vehicle, the Cybervan.
      Both vehicles look like something out of a science fiction movie, embodying Musk‚Äôs motto: ‚ÄúThe future should look
      like the future.‚Äù The highlight of the event, however, was Tesla‚Äôs Optimus Gen 2 robot, which engaged guests by
      serving drinks, chatting and even dancing. The Optimus robot, which was initially touted as a replacement for
      factory workers, is expected to start working at Tesla‚Äôs factories in 2025 and be available for other companies in
      2026. Musk further explained his vision for Optimus, saying that the robot could become a home assistant that
      could take care of children, walk dogs, mow the lawn and do the shopping. He also estimated that when production
      ramps up, Optimus would cost between $20,000 and $30,000, offering a more affordable alternative to today‚Äôs
      expensive housework robots.

    <p class="paragraph-one">
      Tesla has emphasized the technological continuity between its cars and robots, with Optimus
      sharing key technologies such as battery power, advanced motors, software and AI systems
      that were originally developed for Tesla's electric cars. "It's a robot with arms and legs
      instead of a robot with wheels," Musk explained.
      <br><br>
      Tesla is not alone in the robotics market. Hyundai-owned
      Boston Dynamics already offers its Spot robot for $74,500, while other companies such as Nvidia
      and Figure are developing their own robots. According to Goldman Sachs, the global robotics market could reach $38
      billion by 2035, with affordable robots becoming more common sooner than expected.
