      We've seen Samsung make videos several times before. Now Apple is releasing a video criticizing Samsung again.
    </h1>

    <p class="paragraph-one">
      In the past, Samsung has released quite a few videos mocking Apple, but now
      One Plus has also decided to use Samsung as a representative in mocking
      alluding to the internal software that it is not smooth.
      As you all know, Samsung
      has always released various commercial videos for Apple for a long time
      since the iPhone's notch or Apple has not been able to produce
      foldable phones, etc., and there are many more, and it's not just Samsung
      Even Google is shooting at Apple, which could be a market
      Compared to the top smartphone brands
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph-one">
      But recently, OnePlus released a new software update called OxygenOS
      15, and in a OnePlus event video
      there was a clip showing a comparison with the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra
      which runs on OneUI 6.1.
    </p>

    <img src="https://tech-cambodia.com/cms/assets/b2179cd6-3f67-431d-8d44-2813d7702a6f" alt="OxygenOS vs OneUI" />

    <p class="paragraph-one">
      For this test, they tested the application swiping up and down, which on OnePlus
      which uses OxygenOS 15 is very smooth and smooth
      but when swiping on the application on the S24 Ultra, it seems not smooth, not slippery
      but rather awkward. For OxygenOS 15
      this time, they also confirmed that they focused on speed as well as animation
      to be better, because they also compared it with the previous OxygenOS 14 generation.
      And for those who are using Samsung, they are definitely looking forward to OneUI 7
      because Android 15 is already out and according to leaked information, OneUI 7
      may be released at the end of this year or early 2025, maybe wait for the Galaxy S25 Series
      and this time they also focused on animation or visual.
