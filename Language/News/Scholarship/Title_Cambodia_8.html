      ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, has entered the wearable technology market for the first time with the
      launch of Ola Friend, an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered headset.

      <br><br>
      The new device allows users to interact directly with the AI-powered chat app developed by
      ByteDance without having to open their smartphones, the company's latest step in expanding its AI capabilities.

      <br><br>
      The Ola Friend headset, currently only available in China, acts as a voice assistant that can help users with
      tasks such as practicing English, listening to music or finding a partner. The AI ‚Äã‚Äãassistant, called Doubao, is
      powered by the ‚ÄúDoubao Doubao‚Äù wake-up call, which is linked to ByteDance‚Äôs massive language model that powers its
      GenAI service. The headset costs 1,199 yuan (about $170), weighs 6.6 grams each, and comes in four colors: purple,
      silver, black and white. It will go on sale from October 17, and orders can be placed through major Chinese
      e-commerce platforms such as Tmall, JD.com and Douyin, ByteDance‚Äôs app and China‚Äôs version of TikTok. The launch
      comes after ByteDance‚Äôs acquisition of Shenzhen-based wearable technology company Oladance, which was completed
      last month. The acquisition furthers ByteDance‚Äôs expansion into the hardware market
      , a project that began in 2019 when the company acquired local smartphone brand Smartisan
      and later invested in virtual reality (VR) by acquiring VR startup Pico in 2021.
      <br><br>
      The Ola Friend announcement comes as ByteDance is increasing its focus on generative AI, fueled by the global
      growth of
      AI following the release of ChatGPT. ByteDance‚Äôs Doubao has quickly become the most used GenAI app
      in China, with 47 million monthly active users as of September
      ahead of rivals like Baidu‚Äôs Ernie Bot and Moonshot AI‚Äôs Kimi.
      <br><br>
      The entry into the AI-powered wearables market puts ByteDance in line with other tech companies like
      Meta and Snap, which are looking to launch new AI-powered hardware products, including smart glasses.
      As competition intensifies in the AI ‚Äã‚Äãspace, ByteDance is betting on devices like Ola Friend
      to differentiate itself and push the boundaries of AI-enabled consumer technology.
