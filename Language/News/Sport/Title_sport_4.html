    <p class="paragraph-one">
      The Cambodian Swimming Federation, on the afternoon of December 9, 2024, at the federation's own location, opened
      a Level 1 swimming coach training course under the support of Olympic Solidarity (Olympic Solidarity Coaching
      Course Of Swimming In Level 1).

      Mr. Hem Kiri, Secretary General of the Cambodian Swimming Federation, said that in other countries, if you want to
      participate in various training courses, you have to pay money to learn and expand your knowledge of your skills.
      But in Cambodia, there is attention from the NOCC, the Ministry of Education, and international federations. They
      always initiate continuous training courses without considering any budget, meaning that participants only spend
      their time coming to study.
      <br><br>

      The swimming expert added that the participants had a special opportunity to work with experienced foreign
      teachers who were full of international experience, so they had to pay attention and work hard to learn both
      theory and practice over the course of a few days.
      <br>
      Mr. Hal Kiri hopes that the participants will use the knowledge they learned in this training course to train and
      expand the pool of male and female swimmers in Cambodia to respond to the federation's past efforts.
      <br><br>
      He also stated that The Olympic Solidarity Coaching Course of Swimming in Level 1, supported by Olympic
      Solidarity, was held from December 9 to 13, 2024 at the Federation's location in the National Stadium. A total of
      25 participants participated, with an international instructor named Lopez Alvarado Miguel Angel, a Spanish
      national.
