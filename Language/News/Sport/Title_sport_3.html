      Mr. Heng Sokcheat, Acting Deputy Secretary General of the Table Tennis Federation, said that the expert instructor from Australia who came to teach this course has good techniques and shared his knowledge and experience with the 25 participants who came to participate. From what he saw, the expert instructor focused on many techniques such as curling serves, backhands, and various other movements. At the same time, after studying theory, the trainees directly practiced training the youth in the kindergarten.

      The federation representative added that the trainees gained knowledge and showed a lot of progress after participating in the Olympic training course. Technically, progress on the international stage is that the instructors taught with care for all trainees.
