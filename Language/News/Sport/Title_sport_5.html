    <p class="paragraph-one">
      The job of a manager of a team is not easy. Sometimes they are not encouraged or rewarded. On the contrary, they are often fired if they do not lead the team according to the club's wishes. The same goes for bonuses. The most successful managers receive an incentive bonus, while managers who are immediately fired receive money in exchange for their dismissal, or what is called a severance pay.

      <br><br>
      As a leader, all managers receive different salaries, more or less, depending on the popularity or success they have helped the club. And to make you know more clearly today, Sabay would like to highlight the 10 highest-paid managers of 2024:
      <br><br>
      1- Pep Guardiola: The manager who is considered the strongest currently leads Manchester City, and the 53-year-old man currently receives the highest salary in the world. Â£20 million per year.
      <br><br>
      2- Mikel Arteta: Pep's former assistant and Arsenal manager is also not far behind, earning the second highest paid manager in 2024, earning Â£15 million per year.
      <br><br>
      3- Diego Simeone: He is currently managing Atletico Madrid and is the third highest paid manager in the world, earning Â£10.1 million per year.
      <br><br>
      4-Carlo Ancelotti: â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹6- Jorge Jesus: Although not a world-famous manager, the Al Hilal manager is also one of the highest paid, earning Â£8.4 million per year.
      <br><br>
      7- Unai Emery: The Aston Villa manager is also having a great time, having helped the team to the UEFA Champions League and only losing one of their four games in Europe's top competition.
