      A visit to Pattaya is a wonderful way to explore the beaches along the Gulf of Thailand. Relaxed and family-friendly Jomtien Beach is a hot spot for watersports and seaside massages. The giant Buddha of Wat Khao Phra Bat keeps watch over the city, and the wooden Wang Boran Sanctuary of Truth pays homage to Buddhist and Hindu art and architecture. At night, tons of bars and strip clubs attract an adults-only crowd.

      <br><br>
      ·ûòStretching from Pattaya Beach Road to Bali Hai Plaza, Walking Street is the epicenter of Pattaya‚Äôs notorious red-light district, with pubs, nightclubs, and go-go bars galore. Experience the electric atmosphere, catch a free Muay Thai match, and enjoy the live bands and cabarets. When the sensory overload gets too much, take a breather at Pattaya Pier‚Äîan iconic landmark in the city. Food-wise, there are a plethora of stalls, casual eateries, and restaurants that stay open to accommodate late-night revelers. Stay safe, and if you feel uncomfortable, look for tourist police stationed in the area. ‚Äì Tripadvisor

    Open daily from 8.30am to 3.30pm, the Grand Palace is a popular attraction located in Old City and costs 500 baht (approximately AU$20) which includes entry into the Grand Palace as well as Abhisek Dusit Throne Hall and Vimanmek Palace. It‚Äôs the intricate detail and impeccable architecture of this grand old dame that makes the Grand Palace so special. The awe-inspiring beauty is a tribute to the craftsmanship and creativity of the Thai people.

The Grand Palace Bangkok is considered the spiritual heart of the Kingdom of Thailand and the palace complex features a number of impressive buildings including the Temple of the Emerald Buddha (Wat Phra Kaew) which houses the small but famous and widely revered Emerald Buddha dating back to the 14th century. Considered Thailand‚Äôs most important Buddhist temple, Wat Phra Kaew enshrines the meticulously carved jade Buddha in the Lanna school meditating position.
    <br><br>

    Despite their proximity to each other, visitors will notice some distinct contrasts in the style of both the Grand Palace and Temple of the Emerald Buddha. The Temple is very Thai in style while the Grand Palace is much more European inspired. The impressive interior of the Palace is still used for important ceremonies such as coronations and also features the antique throne which was used prior to the Western one currently in use.

One of the most sacred sites in Thailand, strict dress codes apply to all visitors. Men are required to wear shirts with sleeves and long pants. No bare feet are allowed, so any visitors wearing flip flops or sandals must also wear socks. Women must also dress modestly, so no bare shoulders or see-through clothing. If you arrive at the attraction ill-prepared, a booth at the entrance will provide clothes to cover you properly for a refundable deposit.
    See Pattaya in all its historic, action-packed glory on this tour. Led by an enthusiastic and friendly local guide, explore the Wat Phra Yai ‚ÄúBig Buddha‚Äù temple, the Sanctuary of Truth, and other iconic sacred sites. Wander through the stalls and galleries of the Pattaya floating market, and try authentic food and drink from all regions of Thailand. Visit a viewpoint that looks over the Gulf of Thailand and Pattaya Bay.
