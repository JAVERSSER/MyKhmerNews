      What is satellite internet and how is it different from the internet we use every day?
    </h1>

    <p class="paragraph-one">
      The internet we use today and satellite internet don't seem to be much different, because they are used to connect
      general users to the internet in the same way. However, there are some differences, such as:

    <p class="paragraph-one">

      The internet used today is for general public use, such as using the internet on mobile phones, using it at home,
      in schools, companies or other institutions. Those internets are under the image that we often see, such as Wi-Fi
      blocks (modem, router) and wireless masts placed in many areas.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph-one">
      These networks are connected from region to region, as well as from country to country, through cables buried
      underground and under the sea, stretching for tens of kilometers.

      alt="OxygenOS vs OneUI" />

    <p class="paragraph-one">
      These internets are fast and affordable, with many options depending on the speed of the user. But for satellite
      internet, it is not the same.

      Satellite internet is not for general use, it is designed for connecting to remote places, places where cables
      cannot be stretched and places with obstacles that are difficult for people to access, etc. For example, satellite
      internet refers to users such as airplanes, seafarers, forest locations, using maps, or for research in any area.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph-one">
      In short, the internet we use on Earth and satellite internet that is far from Earth do not seem to be much
      different. They are created depending on the needs and obstacles that people encounter only.

      However, satellite internet is now starting to improve in speed, with many researchers trying to launch satellites
      closer to Earth.
