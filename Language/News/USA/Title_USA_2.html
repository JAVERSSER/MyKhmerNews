      Donald Trump
    </h1>

    <p class="paragraph-one">
      Donald Trump was born on June 14, 1946, in Queens, New York.
       His father was a wealthy real-estate developer and his mother was a homemaker. 
       Trump, the fourth of five children and the second son, attended a private boarding school in rural New York for high school.
        He spent his first two years of college at New York City‚Äôs Fordham University, before completing his education at the University 
        of Pennsylvania‚Äôs Wharton School of Finance and Commerce (known now as the Wharton School).

After graduation, Trump returned to New York City and began working for his father‚Äôs real-estate business. 
In 1971 he became president of a collection of family-owned businesses, which he later named the Trump Organization.

    <p class="paragraph-one">
      FROM BUSINESSMAN TO POLITICIAN
After taking control of the Trump Organization, Trump continued to work in real-estate development but also expanded into other businesses. 
He purchased sports teams, published books, and served as the producer and host of a reality TV show called The Apprentice. 
He married his third wife and future first lady, model Melania Knauss, in 2005. 
(Trump was previously married to model Ivana Zeln√≠ƒçkov√° and actress Marla Maples.)

      THE 2016 ELECTION
Trump‚Äôs opponent in the 2016 election was Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state and wife to former U.S.
 president Bill Clinton. Because of Trump's lack of experience in public service and the untraditional way he ran his campaign,
  many expected Clinton to become the first female president of the United States.
